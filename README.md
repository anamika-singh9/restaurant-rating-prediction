# Restaurant Rating Prediction 🍽️

## 📌 Project Overview
This project predicts restaurant aggregate ratings using machine learning regression techniques based on cost, booking availability, online delivery, and price range features.

The project includes:
- Data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Feature encoding and scaling
- Training and evaluating multiple regression models
- Hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV
- Model comparison using MAE and RMSE
- Saving the best-performing model for deployment

## 📊 Dataset
The dataset contains restaurant-level information including:
- City
- Cuisines
- Average cost for two
- Votes
- Rating text
- Aggregate rating
- Online delivery and table booking options

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- Joblib

---

## 🧠 Machine Learning Models Implemented
- Linear Regression
- Support Vector Regressor (SVR)
- Decision Tree Regressor
- Random Forest Regressor
